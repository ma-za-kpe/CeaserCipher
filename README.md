# CeaserCipher

## PROJECT AUTHOR
- MAKU PAULINE MAZAKPE

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
-Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding, and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".
